## Currently Offered Solutions

### SAP Procurement
This solution allows you to extend your core procure-to-pay business processes enabled within SAP. The accelerator contains the building blocks necessary to streamline all the SAP screens and attributes related to a core procure-to-pay process into one simple screen in Power Apps. The Power Apps are supported by further automation of processes behind the scenes using Power Automate flows, SAP ERP Connector and Microsoft Dataverse. These components are fully extensible to rapidly deploy and meet your business requirements including connecting into additional line of business systems and workflows.

### Employee Kudos

Enables individual teammates to celebrate co-workers for their contributions. There are many more exciting solutions on the roadmap such as Awards & Recognitions which enables employees to nominate individuals & teams for awards and Employee Onboarding which partners new employees with current employees and mentors to facilitate new employee onboarding, especially in a hybrid work environment. All with easy to use interface with data stored in Microsoft Dataverse. Available for both web and mobile devices.

### Employee Awards and Recognition

The Awards and Recognition template streamlines and automates the process of acknowledging outstanding efforts in an organization. By facilitating an engaging, inclusive, and efficient awards system, the app aims to encourage a positive work culture that recognizes and appreciates exceptional contributions.

### Onboarding Buddy

The Onboarding Buddy template helps your organization set up and automate a new or transfer employee's mentoring experience. Existing employees sign up to be onboarding buddies and are paired with folks that are onboarding to help them onboard and ramp up successfully. By implementing Onboarding Buddy and customizing it for their unique needs, organizations can create a more engaging, supportive, and efficient onboarding process, optimally leading to benefits such as: reduced time-to-be-productive, increased employee engagement, strengthened community and culture, and reduced turnover.
